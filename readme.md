## Introduction
Power Apps is a low-code platform that enables developers to build custom business applications quickly. However, the development process can involve repetitive actions that consume time and effort. This repository offers a set of automations that can simplify and accelerate various aspects of Power Apps development, allowing developers to focus more on designing and implementing application logic.

## Features
This repository provides the following automation tools and scripts:

## Bulk Create Items in SharePoint List

The "Bulk Create Items in SharePoint List" automation provides a streamlined solution for creating multiple items simultaneously in a SharePoint list. This automation script allows you to import a CSV or Excel file containing the data for the items you want to create. It then processes the file, maps the columns to the corresponding fields in the SharePoint list, and performs the bulk creation of the items. By leveraging this automation, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required to populate a SharePoint list with multiple items, making data entry tasks more efficient.

## Create Columns in SharePoint List

The "Create Columns in SharePoint List" automation simplifies the process of adding new columns to a SharePoint list. Instead of manually creating each column one by one through the SharePoint UI, this automation script allows you to define the column properties and configurations in a convenient format, such as a JSON file. The script then automates the creation of the columns in the specified SharePoint list, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different column creations. With this automation, you can easily manage and update columns in your SharePoint lists, saving valuable development time and effort.

## Create Lists in SharePoint

The "Create Lists in SharePoint" automation facilitates the creation of new lists within a SharePoint site. With this automation script, you can define the list properties and configurations using a simple JSON file or through command-line parameters. The script automates the process of creating the lists, including the setup of columns, views, and any additional configurations specified. By utilizing this automation, you can quickly and consistently create new lists in SharePoint, empowering you to efficiently organize and manage data within your SharePoint sites.

## Remove Title as Mandatory

The "Remove Title as Mandatory" automation offers a solution to remove the mandatory requirement for the "Title" field in SharePoint lists. In some scenarios, the "Title" field is automatically set as mandatory by default, which can be restrictive when designing custom lists. This automation script allows you to remove the mandatory setting for the "Title" field, granting you more flexibility in defining your own mandatory and non-mandatory fields based on your specific requirements. By using this automation, you can customize the mandatory settings of SharePoint list fields, providing a more tailored and user-friendly experience for your users.
